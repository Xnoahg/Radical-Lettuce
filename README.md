untitled lettuce game (hosted via pages)
Untitled lettuce game is a game kinda like subway surfers i made a while back entirely in scratch as a chalenge.
the problem is its bigger than scratch can handle, so i used turbowarp packager to make it into a website.
i went back and forth trying to find somewhere to host it but nothing worked well or just plain out didnt work at all.
then i remembered github has webhosting so im trying it out
- Github TYSM pages is a lifesaver
